## Usage of the minigames module
For now uni can only do minesweeper which is summoned by saying
```
hey uni play minesweeper
```

## Usage of the unibucks module
Made entirely for fun as well but you could let your gambling habits go wild here
######
The best part about this is that there is no consequences for losing everything!
######
But you probably won't win anything either :Â­P
######
#### Balence check
```
hey uni <bank/wallet/balance>
```

#### Slot machine roll
```
hey uni slot roll
```
### Blackjack
#### Starting a game of blackjack
```
hey uni play blackjack <amount to bet>
```
###### Note: Uni will not accept bets that are under 0 or above the amount of money you have in your balance
#### Blackjack Hit
```
hey uni hit
```
#### Blackjack Stay
```
hey uni stay
```
#### Getting daily pay
```
hey uni daily
```
###### Note: The range of how much you could get is 20 to 2500

## Admin related things
To be able to set roles as an "admin role" you must do
```
hey uni set admin role <role name or ping here>
```
#####
Someone being a little annoying or just anything that gets him/her banned?
#####
Well uni is able to use the ban hammer ability in case you want uni to do so
```
hey uni <ban/perish> <name or ping here>
```
##### Note: if she returns more than one user she will not ban all of the users listed
To be able to clear messages from chat you do
```
hey uni clear <number here>
```

##### If the derpibooru module is enabled and you want to swap out filters you'll do
```
hey uni set derpi filter <filter ID>
```

## Lua things
Uni also has the ability to parse lua code for every message that's posted in chat
For whatever reason you want to use it for like deleting messages if they contained something it's an available option
##### Notes: All commands related to her lua module will need admin role to modify
##### And her lua package was not mine, it's been slightly modified to have people not modify important variables [here's the original](https://github.com/yuin/gopher-lua)
#### Enabling
```
hey uni enable lua
```
##### Editing the lua script
It's a little awkward but you kinda need to post all of her lua code inside a message
But one way to do it is
```
hey uni rewrite lua ```lua
print("test")```
```
And in case you want to review your lua code you'll do
```
hey uni view lua
```
